**Project Overview: Weather Forecast Web Application**

**Description:**
This project is a web-based weather forecast application that allows users to retrieve current weather information for a specified city. Users input the city name, and upon clicking "Get Weather," the application fetches and displays details such as temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.

**Features:**
- **City Search:** Users can enter a city name to get weather information.
- **Weather Display:** Displays current weather details including temperature, weather description, humidity percentage, and wind speed.
- **Dynamic Updates:** The application dynamically updates the weather information based on user input using the OpenWeatherMap API.

**Structure:**
- **HTML:** Defines the structure of the page, including input fields and weather result display.
- **CSS:** Provides styling for layout, input fields, buttons, and weather details for a clean and intuitive user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Implements functionality to fetch weather data asynchronously from the OpenWeatherMap API, handle user input, and update the DOM with weather details.

**Technologies Used:**
- **HTML:** For structuring the content and user interface elements.
- **CSS:** For styling the application layout and enhancing user experience.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing dynamic behavior, fetching data from an API, and updating the UI based on user interactions.

**Next Steps:**
- **Enhancements:** Consider adding features like multiple-day forecasts, geolocation-based weather retrieval, or unit conversion options.
- **User Experience:** Improve accessibility and responsiveness for different devices and screen sizes.
- **Deployment:** Host the application online to make it accessible to users globally for checking weather conditions in real-time.
